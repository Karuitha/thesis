  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Asset tangibility </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Firms can use tangible assets as collateral for debt funding. Thus, firms with more tangible assets usually have more debt at a lower cost than firms with less tangible assets (Campello and Giambona , 2011;
Ojah and Ombati , 2016). </td>

  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Profitability, dividend and equity repurchases, and earnings volatility </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Profitable firms are usually large and mature with free cash flows to support debt repayment and thus hold more debt. Firms take up debt to minimise cash that managers could misallocate. The debtholders act as delegated monitors and further act to monitor management. Similarly levered are small fast-growing firms which generate non-debt tax shields from their capital expenditures. Thus, small but fast-growing firms have higher leverage.
Firms with higher volatility have a higher probability of financial distress than those with lower volatility. Thus, firms with high earnings volatility take up less debt. (Barclay and Smith , 2005; Gwatidzo and Ojah , 2009; Ojah and Ombati, 2016). </td>

  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Competitiveness </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Unlike firms operating in monopolistic or oligopolistic market conditions, firms in competitive industries have lower debt. The high debt would make a firm lose competitive advantage in the product market given that interest increases operating leverage (De Jong et al., 2011) </td>

  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Size and growth rate </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> A large firm that has high profits, more tangible assets, and limited growth options and thus, uses debt to reduce free cash flows to curb agency conflicts. Small firms, unlike large firms, need to maintain flexibility to avoid agency costs of underinvestments. Hence, they rely more on equity (Barclay and Smith, 2005; Barclay et al., 2006; Gwatidzo and Ojah, 2009). </td>

  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Bankruptcy, financial distress costs and credit ratings </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Firms with more debt have a higher probability of financial distress and hence borrow less. The opposite is the case for firms with less debt. Firms with higher credit ratings have higher debt, unlike firms with low credit ratings that have low debt (Barclay and Smith, 2005; De Jong et al., 2011. </td>

  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Firm access to capital markets </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The better chance the firm has access to the capital markets, the easier it can raise both debt and equity. A firmâ€™s access to capital markets is a function of its size and financial performance . High-quality firms tend to have more leverage as they have the option to raise both debt and equity with ease. Medium quality firms are usually bank-oriented and have medium levels of debt. Low-quality firms rely on private debt which is costly or unavailable. Thus, they tend to have low leverage (Barclay and Smith, 2005; Ehrhardt and Brigham, 2016; Ojah and Ombati, 2016). </td>

  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Internal funds deficiency and investment programs </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> A firm with internal funds deficiency that has good investment options will issue more debt instruments. On the other hand, a firm with adequate internal cash and poor investment prospects tends to issue equity (De Jong et al., 2011). </td>

  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> State of stock and bond markets, and the degree of firm capital market orientation </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> If the stock market is bullish, the firm will issue equity as the firm maximises net cash issue proceeds. In a bear market, managers will favour debt.  Additionally, firms will issue debt when it is cheaper and less risky than equity, and thus the cost of debt (interest rate) is a significant determinant of capital structure (Ehrhardt and Brigham, 2016). </td>

  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Tax factors </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Debt gives a tax advantage to firms, but the costs of financial distress can outweigh the tax advantage of debt. The cut-off where the tax advantage of debt outweighs the costs of financial distress is not clear-cut. However, firms will always seek to maximise the interest tax shield while guarding against the costs of financial distress. Most firms will have debt in their capital structure to take advantage of the interest tax shield (De Jong et al., 2011). </td>

  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Peer or industry capital structure </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Financing patterns of firms tend to follow the financing structures of their peers, especially the better-performing ones. Thus, firms in an industry tend to have similar financing structures (Ehrhardt and Brigham, 2016). </td>

  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Managerial factors </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Managers strive towards earning extra material rents (perquisites). Hence, they favour higher profitability and larger firms. Managers adopt capita structures that maximise their wealth. Research indicates that inside/ managerial ownership is positively related to higher leverage. However, other researchers find the opposite and the debate is still unsettled (Agrawal and Mandelker, 1987; Kim and Sorensen, 1986; Jensen et al., 1992). </td>
